    <div class="bio">
      <p> Hi! I am Melanie Jackson (You can call me Mel or Melanie :D )  I am a 15 year old African-American Girl and a rising sophomore at Cardinal O’Hara High School in Springfield, PA. I live in Aldan, PA with my Mom, Dad, and twin brother, Chase. Aldan is a fairly small town in Delaware county about 6 miles from Philadelphia (Its closer to south Philadelphia). I was born in Abington, PA. When I was younger from about a few months old to 4 years old I lived in Rockland County, New York. This area is in the mountains and its about 30 miles from the city. Growing up I was exposed to a lot of music (I Love Music A lot :D), I listen to all types but my top favorites are Jazz, R&B and house.  At school I am in honors classes, yearbook, CSC, CAC, Genesis, and the Tennis team. My team has won 5 consecutive championships and this upcoming season we're working on our 6th. GO LIONS!</p> </div>

<h3>My Experiences</h3>

</div>
      <p class="mainheadtext"> This year I took Tech Comm at my school. This year we worked on the basics (Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc). Then towards the end of the year we were learning coding on Code.org. As I was working I had put my head down, since I was done. I normally finished quickly because I caught on to HTML pretty quickly. The teacher came over to me and asked me "Hey "Jane" (This name has been changed for this story) are you done?" Jane was another black girl in the freshman class, I go to a predominately white school, but there is a good amount of minorities. Jane wasn't even in my class. We had about the same skin tone but at the time we did not have the same hair, we did not have the same height, and most importantly, we didn't have the same name! This angered me a bit, I did not correct him because I did not want to see or talk to him at all. Now I would give him the benefit of the doubt, I never really talked much to him so maybe he did not know me well enough to know my name. But, Since I go to a predominately white school, I don't think you shouldn't know our names. This is my example of  a bad experience I had today, the next is a good experience. My next experience is Kode with Klossy! I am so glad that I got to participate this year! (I signed up last year and got in, but was later unable to go.) Being at camp with the amazing Scholars and Instructors/TA's was great! I feel a lot more confident in my coding skills. With my new skills I want to try to make a difference. I am also a girl scout. I am planning for my Gold Project.  I've been brainstorming ways to incorporate coding into it. My main goal would be teaching girls that they can code and that they should consider a job in computer science. Since there is a lower amount of females in the tech world, I want to inspire girls to try something new </p>

        <h3> Growing Up With Tech </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="subheadtext1">

      <p> Since I live in the 21st century and I am a part of Generation Z, I've grown up with technology for all of my life. I still remember playing playstation when I was 4, or playing games on the computer. We've always had the internet and technology very accessible to us, which is both good and bad. It is good because we can use it for school, shopping, talking to friends and family, and alot more. It can be bad because people get addicted to video games, texting, and social media. It can be very dangerous as well, there are people who use technology with bad intentions.  </p> </div>
